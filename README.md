## Computer Vision - Scene Recognition & Image Classification Using CNN

This is an assignment of 110-2 Computer Vision@NTU.

The dataset and trained models are not provided, but one can design a dataset from images in CIFAR-10.

## Part 1. Scene Recognition

* Use SIFT in opencv as a feature extractor. 

* Apply K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm as a weak classifier.

## Part 2. Image Classification

* Use convolutional neural network as a feature extractor and perform image classification.
